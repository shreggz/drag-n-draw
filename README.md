# drag-n-draw
This is a pixelart sketchpad made with HTML/CSS/JS. You can play around with it [here](https://shreggz.github.io/drag-n-draw/). For now, the live demo only works on desktop.

## Functionality
Hovering over a pixel colors it in. You can change the pixel size and color using the buttons, which are mostly self-explanatory. The "rainbow" button fills in pixels with random colors. The "clear" button erases the board but does not otherwise change the settings. Changing the pixel size erases the board but does not change the color setting.

Pixels are colored in by hovering rather than clicking because I wanted the drag-n-draw to have constraints similar to an etch-a-sketch. That is, you have to be strategic about how you enter and exit the board.

## TODO
I plan on revisiting this to add features such as:
- A color picker to have more options
- A better random color generating algorithm so the rainbow feature looks less like clown vomit
- Mobile functionality

## What Was It All For?
I built this as part of the Odin Project's curriculum. The main purpose of this project was to learn about DOM manipulation. I also became more comfortable with functions and event listeners while working on this.

Cheers!
